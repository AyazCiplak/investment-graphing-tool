# Investment Graphing Website (In Development)
Webpage that takes in user input such as investment length, periodic contributions and interest rate, and produces dynamic graphs of investment progression.

# Current next steps: 
- Adjusting input limitations for user input forms
- Implementing javaScript code to track net contribution progression and net interest progression for second graph
